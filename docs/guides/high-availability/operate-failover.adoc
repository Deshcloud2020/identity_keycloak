title="Fail over to the secondary site"
summary="This describes the automatic and operational procedures necessary" >

This {section} describes the steps to fail over from primary site to secondary site in a setup as outlined in <@links.ha id="concepts-active-passive-sync" /> together with the blueprints outlined in <@links.ha id="bblocks-active-passive-sync" />.

== When to use procedure

A failover from the primary site to the secondary site will happen automatically based on the checks configured in the loadbalancer.

When the primary site loses its state in {jdgserver_name} or a network partition occurs that prevents the synchronization, manual procedures are necessary to recover the primary site before it can handle traffic again, see the <@links.ha id="operate-switch-back" /> {section}.

To prevent an automatic fallback to the primary site before those manual steps have been performed, configure the loadbalancer as described following to prevent this from happening automatically.

For a graceful switch to the secondary site, follow the instructions in the <@links.ha id="operate-switch-over" /> {section}.

See the <@links.ha id="introduction" /> {section} for different operational procedures.

== Procedure

Follow these steps to manually force a failover.

=== Route53

To force Route53 to mark the primary site as permanently not available and prevent an automatic fallback, edit the health check in AWS to point to a non-existent route (`health/down`).
