== Concepts

Creating new database connections is expensive as it takes time.
Creating them when a request arrives will delay the response, so it is good to have them created before the request arrives.
It can also contribute to a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_stampede[stampede effect] where creating a lot of connections in a short time makes things worse as it slows down the system and blocks threads.
Closing a connection also invalidates all server side statements caching for that connection.
