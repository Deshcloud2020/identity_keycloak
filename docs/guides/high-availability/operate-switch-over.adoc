title="Switch over to the secondary site"
summary="This topic describes the operational procedures necessary" >

This procedure switches from the primary site to the secondary site when using a setup as outlined in <@links.ha id="concepts-active-passive-sync" /> together with the blueprints outlined in <@links.ha id="bblocks-active-passive-sync" />.

include::partials/infinispan/infinispan-attributes.adoc[]

== When to use this procedure

Use this procedure to gracefully take the primary offline.

Once the primary site is back online, use the {sections} <@links.ha id="operate-network-partition-recovery" /> and <@links.ha id="operate-switch-back" /> to return to the original state with the primary site being active.

See the <@links.ha id="introduction" /> {section} for different operational procedures.

== Procedures

=== {jdgserver_name} Cluster

For the context of this {section}, `{site-a}` is the primary site and `{site-b}` is the secondary site.

When you are ready to take a site offline, a good practice is to disable the replication towards it.
This action prevents errors or delays when the channels are disconnected between the primary and the secondary site.

==== Procedures to transfer state from secondary to primary site

. Log in into your secondary site

<#include "partials/infinispan/infinispan-cli-connect.adoc" />

. Disable the replication to the primary site by running the following command:
+
.Command:
[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----
site take-offline --all-caches --site={site-a-cr}
----
+
.Output:
[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----
{
  "offlineClientSessions" : "ok",
  "authenticationSessions" : "ok",
  "sessions" : "ok",
  "clientSessions" : "ok",
  "work" : "ok",
  "offlineSessions" : "ok",
  "loginFailures" : "ok",
  "actionTokens" : "ok"
}
----

. Check the replication status is `offline`.
+
.Command:
[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----
site status --all-caches --site={site-a-cr}
----
+
.Output:
[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----
{
  "status" : "offline"
}
----
+
If the status is not `offline`, repeat the previous step.

The {jdgserver_name} cluster in the secondary site is ready to handle requests without trying to replicate to the primary site.

=== AWS Aurora Database

include::partials/aurora/aurora-failover.adoc[]

=== {project_name} Cluster

No action required.

=== Route53

To force Route53 to mark the primary site as not available, edit the health check in AWS to point to a non-existent route (`health/down`).  After some minutes, the clients will notice the change and traffic will gradually move over to the secondary site.
