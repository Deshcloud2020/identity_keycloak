Assuming a Regional multi-AZ Aurora deployment, the current writer instance should be in the same region as the active {project_name} cluster to avoid latencies and communication across availability zones.

Switching the writer instance of Aurora will lead to a short downtime. The writer instance in the other site with a slightly longer latency might be acceptable for some deployments.
Therefore, this situation might be deferred to a maintenance window or skipped depending on the circumstances of the deployment.

To change the writer instance, run a failover.
This change will make the database unavailable for a short time.
{project_name} will need to re-establish database connections.

To fail over the writer instance to the other AZ, issue the following command:

[source,bash]
----
aws rds failover-db-cluster  --db-cluster-identifier ...
----
