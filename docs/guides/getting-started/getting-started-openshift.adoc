== Before you start

include::templates/hw-requirements.adoc[]

. Install https://code-ready.github.io/crc/[Red Hat Code Ready Containers] and follow the steps in the documentation to install a 
local OpenShift cluster.

. Make sure the cluster is functional by entering the following command:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
crc status
----

. Look for output similar to the following to confirm the cluster is working.
+
[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
CRC VM:          Running
OpenShift:       Running
...
----

. Log in as the user `developer`:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
oc login -u developer -p developer
----

. Create a project called `keycloak` by entering the following command:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
oc new-project keycloak
----

== Start {project_name}

. To start a {project_name} server in your project, enter the following command:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
oc process -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keycloak/keycloak-quickstarts/latest/openshift/keycloak.yaml \
    -p KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=admin \
    -p KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin \
    -p NAMESPACE=keycloak \
| oc create -f -
----
+
In this example, the user name and password are `admin`.

. Once the command above completes, look for a message similar to this:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
service/keycloak created
route.route.openshift.io/keycloak created
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/keycloak created.
----
+
At this point, OpenShift will provision a {project_name} pod and related resources. As part of the process, OpenShift will
try to pull the {project_name} server image. This operation might take some time depending on your network connection.

. To make sure {project_name} is provisioned, execute the following command:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
oc get pods
----

. After a while, look for a message similar to the following; it indicates the pod is ready:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
NAME                READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
keycloak-1-deploy   0/1       Completed   0          1h
keycloak-1-l9kdx    1/1       Running     0          1h
----

. Once the server is provisioned, enter the following command to find out the {project_name} URLs:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
KEYCLOAK_URL=https://$(oc get route keycloak --template='{{ .spec.host }}') &&
echo "" &&
echo "{project_name}:                 $KEYCLOAK_URL" &&
echo "{project_name} Admin Console:   $KEYCLOAK_URL/admin" &&
echo "{project_name} Account Console: $KEYCLOAK_URL/realms/myrealm/account" &&
echo ""
----

Remember these URLs as you will need them throughout this {section}. The URL for the account console won't work
right now as you will need to create the realm first.
