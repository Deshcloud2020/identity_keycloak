= Defining actions required at login

You can set the actions that a user must perform at the first login. These actions are required after the user provides credentials. After the first login, these actions are no longer required. You add required actions on the *Details* tab of that user.

Some required actions are automatically triggered for the user during login even if they are not explicitly added to this user by the administrator. For example `Update password` action can be
triggered if <<_password-policies, Password policies>> are configured in a way that the user password needs to be changed every X days. Or `verify profile`
action can require the user to update the <<user-profile, User profile>> as long as some user attributes do not match the requirements according to the user profile configuration.

The following are examples of required action types:

Update Password:: 
   The user must change their password.

Configure OTP::
   The user must configure a one-time password generator on their mobile device using either the Free OTP or Google Authenticator application.

Verify Email::
   The user must verify their email account. An email will be sent to the user with a validation link that they must click. Once this workflow is successfully completed, the user will be allowed to log in.

Update Profile::
   The user must update profile information, such as name, address, email, and phone number.
