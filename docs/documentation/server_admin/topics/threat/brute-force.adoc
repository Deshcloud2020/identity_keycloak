=== Brute force attacks

A brute force attack attempts to guess a user's password by trying to log in multiple times. {project_name} has brute force detection capabilities and can temporarily disable a user account if the number of login failures exceeds a specified threshold.

[NOTE]
====
{project_name} disables brute force detection by default. Enable this feature to protect against brute force attacks.
====

.Procedure

To enable this protection:

. Click *Realm Settings* in the menu
. Click the *Security Defenses* tab.
. Click the *Brute Force Detection* tab.

{project_name} can deploy permanent lockout and temporary lockout actions when it detects an attack. Permanent lockout disables a user account until an administrator re-enables it. Temporary lockout disables a user account for a specific period of time.
The time period that the account is disabled increases as the attack continues and subsequent failures reach multiples of `Max Login Failures`.

[NOTE]
====
When a user is temporarily locked and attempts to log in, {project_name} displays the default `Invalid username or password` error message. This message is the same error message as the message displayed for an invalid username or invalid password to ensure the attacker is unaware the account is disabled.
====

*Common Parameters*

|===
|Name |Description |Default

|Max Login Failures
|The maximum number of login failures.
|30 failures.

|Quick Login Check Milliseconds
|The minimum time between login attempts.
|1000 milliseconds.

|Minimum Quick Login Wait
|The minimum time the user is disabled when login attempts are quicker than _Quick Login Check Milliseconds_.
|1 minute.

|===

*Temporary Lockout Parameters*

|===
|Name |Description |Default

|Wait Increment
|The time added to the time a user is temporarily disabled when the user's login attempts exceed _Max Login Failures_.
|1 minute.

|Max Wait
|The maximum time a user is temporarily disabled.
|15 minutes.

|Failure Reset Time
|The time when the failure count resets. The timer runs from the last failed login. Make sure this number is always greater than `Max wait`; otherwise the effective
wait time will never reach the value you have set to `Max wait`.
|12 hours.

|===

*Temporary Lockout Algorithm*
====
. On successful login
.. Reset `count`
. On failed login
.. If the time between this failure and the last failure is greater than _Failure Reset Time_
... Reset `count`
.. Increment `count`
.. Calculate `wait` using _Wait Increment_ * (`count` / _Max Login Failures_). The division is an integer division rounded down to a whole number
.. If `wait` equals 0 and the time between this failure and the last failure is less than _Quick Login Check Milliseconds_, set `wait` to _Minimum Quick Login Wait_.
... Temporarily disable the user for the smallest of `wait` and _Max Wait_ seconds
... Increment the temporary lockout counter

`count` does not increment when a temporarily disabled account commits a login failure.
====

For instance, if you have set `Max Login Failures` to `5` and a `Wait Increment` of `30` seconds, the effective time an account will be disabled after several failed authentication attempts will be:

[cols="1,1,1,1"]
|===
|`Number of Failures` | `Wait Increment`  | `Max Login Failures` | `Effective Wait Time`
|1 |30 | 5 | 0
|2 |30 | 5 | 0
|3 |30 | 5 | 0
|4 |30 | 5 | 0
|**5** |**30** | 5 | **30**
|6 |30 | 5 | 30
|7 |30 | 5 | 30
|8 |30 | 5 | 30
|9 |30 | 5 | 30
|**10** |**30** | 5 | **60**
|===

Note that the `Effective Wait Time` at the 5th failed attempt will disable the account for `30` seconds. Only after reaching
the next multiple of `Max Login Failures`, in this case `10`, will the time increase from `30` to `60`. The time the account will be disabled
is only increased when reaching multiples of `Max Login Failures`.

*Permanent Lockout Parameters*

|===
|Name |Description |Default

|Max temporary Lockouts
|The maximum number of temporary lockouts permitted before permanent lockout occurs.
|0
|===

*Permanent Lockout Flow*
====
. Follow temporary lockout flow
. If temporary lockout counter exceeds Max temporary lockouts
.. Permanently disable user

When {project_name} disables a user, the user cannot log in until an administrator enables the user. Enabling an account resets the `count`.
====

The downside of {project_name} brute force detection is that the server becomes vulnerable to denial of service attacks. When implementing a denial of service attack, an attacker can attempt to log in by guessing passwords for any accounts it knows and eventually causing {project_name} to disable the accounts.

Consider using intrusion prevention software (IPS). {project_name} logs every login failure and client IP address failure. You can point the IPS to the {project_name} server's log file, and the IPS can modify firewalls to block connections from these IP addresses.

==== Password policies

Ensure you have a complex password policy to force users to choose complex passwords. See the <<_password-policies, Password Policies>> chapter for more information. Prevent password guessing by setting up the {project_name} server to use one-time-passwords.
