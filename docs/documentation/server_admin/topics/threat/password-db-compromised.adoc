=== Password database compromised

{project_name} does not store passwords in raw text but as hashed text, using the `PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512` message digest algorithm. {project_name} performs `210,000` hashing iterations, the number of iterations recommended by the security community. This number of hashing iterations can adversely affect performance as PBKDF2 hashing uses a significant amount of CPU resources.
