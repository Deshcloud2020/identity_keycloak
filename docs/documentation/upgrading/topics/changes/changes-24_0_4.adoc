= Partial update to user attributes when updating users through the Admin User API is no longer supported

When updating user attributes through the Admin User API, you cannot execute partial updates when updating the
user attributes, including the root attributes like `username`, `email`, `firstName`, and `lastName`.

If you are updating user attributes through the Admin User API without passing all the attributes that the administrator
has write permissions, the missing attributes will be removed. On the other hand, if an attribute is marked as read-only for
administrators, not sending the attribute won't remove it.

See the link:{adminguide_link}#user-profile[User Profile Documentation] for the details about the user profile settings.
