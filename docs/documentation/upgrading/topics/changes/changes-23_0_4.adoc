= Fix handling of Groups.getSubGroups briefRepresentation parameter

Version 23.0.0 introduced a new endpoint getSubGroups ("children") on the Groups resource, where the meaning of the parameter briefRepresentation meant the retrieval of full representations of the sub groups. The meaning is now changed to return the brief representation.
