= Upgrading {project_name} adapters

[[_upgrade_adapters]]

After you upgrade the {project_name} server, you can upgrade the adapters. Earlier versions of the
adapter might work with later versions of the {project_name} server, but earlier versions of the {project_name} server might not
work with later versions of the adapter.

[[_compatibility_with_older_adapters]]
== Compatibility with older adapters

Newer versions of the {project_name} server potentially work with older versions of the adapters.
However, some fixes of the {project_name} server may break compatibility with older versions
of the adapters. For example, a new implementation of the OpenID Connect specification may not match older client adapter versions.

For this situation, you can use Compatibility modes. For OpenID Connect clients, the Admin Console includes *OpenID Connect Compatibility Modes* on the page with client details. With this option, you can disable some new aspects of the {project_name} server
to preserve compatibility with older client adapters. For more details, see the tool tips of individual switches.
