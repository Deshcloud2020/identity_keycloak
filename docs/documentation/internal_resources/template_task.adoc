= Do One Task

_Start title with verb form such as Creating. Use the gerund form (noun form of verb) for titles, not the imperative form._

_Avoid using the word 'Configuring' over and over.  Other words might include:_

* _Specifying_
* _Adding_
* _Constructing_
* _Arranging_
* _Building_
* _Setting_
* _Managing_
* _Defining_
* _Customizing_
* _Or instead of using synonyms (which becomes obvious) 'verb-alize' a word and refactor the heading - limiting (instead of 'setting resource limits')_

_The standard for all Red Hat documentation is title case for all headings and titles._
