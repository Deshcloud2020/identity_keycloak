= Operator deploys nightly build instead of 24.0.0

Due to an issue in the release process when deploying Keycloak using the Operator it installed the `nightly` container
instead of `24.0.0`.

As a quick fix to the issue, the `24.0.0` container was tagged with `nightly`, and the `nightly` releases was temporarily
disabled.

If you installed or upgraded to `24.0.0` using the Operator before 5pm CET yesterday the database may have been updated
with the wrong versions. To check if you are affected connect to your database and run the following SQL command:

```
SELECT * from migration_model WHERE version = '999.0.0';
```

If the above returns a matching row you will need to take some actions, otherwise database migrations will not run for
future releases. To resolve this run the following SQL command:

```
UPDATE migration_model SET version = '24.0.0' WHERE version = '999.0.0';
```
