==== Security Context

The `KeycloakSecurityContext` interface is available if you need to access to the tokens directly. This could be useful if you want to retrieve additional
details from the token (such as user profile information) or you want to invoke a RESTful service that is protected by {project_name}.

In servlet environments it is available in secured invocations as an attribute in HttpServletRequest:
[source,java]
----
httpServletRequest
    .getAttribute(KeycloakSecurityContext.class.getName());
----

Or, it is available in insecured requests in the HttpSession:

[source,java]
----
httpServletRequest.getSession()
    .getAttribute(KeycloakSecurityContext.class.getName());
----
